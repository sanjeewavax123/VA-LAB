comprehensive vulnerability assessment on my virtual network environment (VMware Workstation) using OpenSCAP!
ðŸš€ Successfully scanned CentOS and Linux Server VMs from a Master VM, generating detailed reports. Analysis of the OpenSCAP results yielded a security score of 70.4.
Excited to share my practical experience in identifying potential weaknesses and strengthening system security.
